Java Programming Day 13
Conditional Statements in Java

All conditional statements work with boolean (true|false). EX: if(boolean condition) { //code to run if condition is TRUE } else { //code to run if condition is FALSE }

char letter = 'Q'; if(letter == 'Q') { System.out.println("Letter is Q"); } else { System.out.println("Letter is NOT Q"); }

if(letter == 'U') { System.out.println("Letter is Q"); } else { System.out.println("Letter is NOT Q"); }

if condition is true, IF BLOCK code will run. if condition is false. ELSE BLOCK code will run.

package day13_conditional_statements add new class ATMPincodeProgram main method print "**** WELCOME TO TD BANK ATM ****" secretPincode => **** inputPincode => ****

if condition checks if secretPincode equals inputPincode true: "Welcome to your account." "You can withdraw, check balance, deposit" false: "Incorrect pincode! 1234" "Please try again."

print "Thank you for using TD Bank ATM!"
DEBUGGING USING INTELLIJ.

When you have bug in your code, and you want to find and fix it, You need todo debug run.

Steps:

put breakpoint by clicking on left side panel where line numbers are. if you do not do this step, debug will not work

Run as DEBUG (BUG ICON)
It will start the program and pause at the breakpoint line.

3) Goto panel below and click on CONSOLE
4) Click on Step Over(broken Arrow) to go step by step.
BENEFIT of DEBUGGING:

-> you can see the flow of execution of your code, and variables values step by step and figure out where is the issue.
temp = 70 or more is nice day

new class NiceDayOrNot main method

temp -> 71

temp = 70 or more is nice day if true: "It is a beautiful day!" "Lets code java"

else
	"It is kind of cold today"
	"Stay home and code java"
add new class BonusCalculator main method

bonus = 0; salesAmount = 2000.55;

if salesAmount <= 1000 "Good job, you qualified for bonus!" -> assign 50 to bonus else "Great job, you are qualified for full bonus" -> assign 100 to bonus

Your bonus for salesAmount is $100
AUTO FORMAT SHORTCUT IN INTELLIJ:

Mac: Command + Option + L

Windows: Control + Alt + L
add new class IFWithBooleanVariable add main method

isHungry -> true / false

check isHungry: true: print out "I am hungry I will go get something to eat" "Then code java" false print out "I am not hungry, Lets keep coding java"

==============================

IF STATEMENT WITH STRING.

We can check if String value equals some other value. We cannot compare if it is >, <=, >=, <. We can do equals comparison. there 2 ways we can compare string if it is equal something:

Using == operator String city = "Fairfax"; if(city == "Fairfax") { print "it is Fairfax"; }

using equals() method/function String city = "Los Angeles"; if(city.equals("Los Angeles")) { print "it is LA" }else{ print "it is not LA" }

add new class StringComparison add main method
