Array -> array is collection of data of same type. Previously our variables stored only single data.

EX: String name = "Mike";

Using arrays we can store one or more values in single array variable. --> In Java, Arrays are fixed length, not resizable, also only store same type of data. c

recruiter/HR (your background, your skills). If you are interested in the particular role. They will go over JD(job description). Also discuss rate, how much you are looking for. My consulting rate is .... Communication skills

technical screening: on the phone/ in zoom: maybe they ask you to code on the screen or just talk.

Final round: with hiring team/ hiring manager: 3 - 5 hours: techincal questions project questions Agile question yourself bevioral questions ....
IQ: What is the difference between Array and ArrayList?

Array is fixed length in java, once we declare array, we cannot resize it.

ArrayList is resizable, we can add / remove data.
Array can store primitives and objects ArrayList can store only objects

add new class MallShopping 0 1 2 3 4 5 String[] items = {"Shoes", "Jacket", "Gloves", "Airpods", "iPad", "iphone 12 case" }; double[] prices = {99.99, 150.0, 9.99, 250.0 , 439.50, 39.99}; int[] itemIDs = {12345 , 12346, 12347, 12348, 12349, 12350};

Can you tell me how much you paid for "iPad" ? 439.50. both in same position in arrays

Shuffle the values in array using random class: int[] itemIDs = {12345 , 12346, 12347, 12348, 12349, 12350};

add new class MaxMinPrice 0 1 2 3 4 5 String[] items = {"Shoes", "Jacket", "Gloves", "Airpods", "iPad", "iphone 12 case" }; double[] prices = {99.99, 150.0, 9.99, 250.0 , 439.50, 39.99}; int[] itemIDs = {12345 , 12346, 12347, 12348, 12349, 12350};

c

find and print details of least expensive item
PSEUDOCODE: Declare: double maxPrice = price of first item int indexOfMaxPrice = index of first item - 0

LOOP STARTS FOR prices Array:
	read price[i] from array
		if price[i] is more than maxPrice
			change maxPrice to price[i]
			set indexOfMaxPrice to i

END FOR LOOP

PRINT items[indexOfMaxPrice] + prices[indexOfMaxPrice] + itemIDs[indexOfMaxPrice]
=================================================

SPLIT - String class method:

SPLIT - break into pieces/chunks in English

SPLIT method in Java -> splits String into Array items, by using the delimiter.

String words = "java;python;ruby";

java python ruby

We can use split method and specify ';' as delimiter to split into array

words.split(";") ==> result will be String[] with 3 values. {"java", "python", "ruby"}

String words2 = "java is fun"; words2.split(" "); ==> String[] {"java","is","fun"}

String cats = "bengal cat tabby cat persian cat no cat here"; words3.split(" cat "); ==> String[]{"bengal", "tabby", "persian", "no" , "here"}

add new class SentenceSplit

String sentence = "java is fun";

=========================== String cats = "bengal cat tabby cat persian cat no cat here";

COUNTING OCCURENCES IN STRING USING SPLIT:

Given below string, count how many "cat" is in String String cats = "bengal cat tabby cat persian cat no cat here";

add new class CountUsingSplit

add new class AWSZones

String app = "etsy";
String zones = "us-east-1,us-west-2,us-west-1"
==========================================

Deploying etsy to us-east-1... Deployment completed for us-east-1

Deploying etsy to us-west-1... Deployment completed for us-west-1

Deploying etsy to us-west-2... Deployment completed for us-west-2

---All deployments complete----

add new class ReverseSentence

java is fun => fun is java wooden spoon search ==> search spoon wooden

hello all => all hello

USING SPLIT FOR EACH CHARACTER: In below examples, we are spliting "java" into separate letterr in array.

String word = "java"; String[] letters = word.split("");

the above will split by each character: letters ==> {"j" , "a", "v" , "a"}

String word = "java"; char[] letters=word.tocharArray(); letters ==> {'j' , 'a', 'v' , 'a'}

Summary: MallShopping arrays manipulation split String method

Tomorrow: More practice of arrays Multi dymensional array
