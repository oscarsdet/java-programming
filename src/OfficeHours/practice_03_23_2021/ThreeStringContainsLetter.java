Given three String variables of some text find and print the longest word that also contains 'a'

    Ex:
        "java"
        "mouse"
        "computer"
        Output: java
    Ex:
        "java"
        "mouse"
        "apples"
        Output: apples

Challenge: Instead of just checking for 'a' add another variable that can be used to check for any character.
