Stop Trying so hard. Achieve more by doing less
	Bethany Butzer
---------------------------------------------

Addicted to achievement - Attention/approval of being successful

- lead to overwork -> burn out

- How are you? A: Busy -> unhealthy

-- Two types of effort

	- Upstream: against the grain
		- getting no where
		- more people are on this path
		- Society supports this

	- Downstream: with the current
		- Still effort
		- Have goal, but focused more on the process to get to the goal, not the actual goal

-- Each person needs their own definition of authentic success
	-> move money? better social connection? more healthy?

-- Inner work

	- Values guide us towards downstream effort

	- How we want to feel everyday (Based on top performers)

		- When there was an obstacles during the road to the goal, they didn't push against it. They took time to remember who they wanted to feel each day

-- Authentic life choices

	- Shouldn't be influenced by others input
	- Won't be easy
	- Speaker -> quit working at Harvard because it was Authentic for her

-- When to know you are engaged in downstream effort

	- Physiological flow - time is distorted due to amount of absorbency

	- Trying but doesn't feel like you're trying

	- Opportunities are given without you giving so much effort
