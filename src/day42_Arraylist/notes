Java programming day 42
Vladislav Shekhovsev — Today at 7:07 PM @Murodil can u please remind what the difference between ArrayList and List ?

ArrayList -> is a class in java List -> is an interface in java

Normal way of declaring arraylist: ArrayList nums = new ArrayList<>();

Polimorphic way of declaring arraylist, this is little more flexible thanks to polymorphism in java. This way is more prefferred by many programmers and more popular. List nums = new ArrayList<>();

Code analysis tools like SonarCube -> prefer List ...

when we learn polymorphism, we will fully understand difference.
Collections class: is a utility class in java to help with many common operations with Arraylist.

It is similar to Arrays class for Arrays.

It has many useful methods:

sort
reverse
frequency
min,max
replaceAll
shuffle .....
add new package day42_arraylist

add class CollectionsUtil
add new class UniqueFromList

main

List nums = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(2, 4, 4, 1, 5, 6, 0, 6));

Nevzat Mutlu — Today at 9:00 PM @Murodil If we write long complex codes, we can simply separate them into methods and even can use them in different classes to organize better right?

Absolutely yes, method in java, should be doing only ONE thing. if it is doing multiple things, it means we need more methods.

Summary:

Collections class methods

custom methods with Arraylist

shortcuts { ctrl + space --> gives suggesstions Select code > right click > Refactor > Extract method

} Next class: little more arraylist custom classes / OOP introduction
