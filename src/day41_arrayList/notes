How to create and assign values to ArrayList in 1 statement.
we can use Arrays.asList method.
1) List<Double> nums1 = Arrays.asList(23, 54, 1, 2.2);

add, remove, clear --> Cannot be used contains, get, isEmpty-  or any otehr methods that does not change the size --> can be sued.
20 List<Doguble> nums 2 = new ArrayList<>(Arrays. asList. etc ->
