Java Programming Day 25
-----------------------
Loops in java:
while loop | do while loop | for loop: 1) for loop with iterator
                                       2) for each loop:
                                               works with collections
In programming:
while loop to read files line by line
read database records one at a time until the last one.
for simple game development we could use while loop/infinite loop
while(file.hasNextLine()){
    String line = file.readline();
    ......
}
-------------------------------------
Selenium automation:
    - while certain element is not visible, keep waiting.
    - while page is still loading, keep waiting for page to finish loading
    - while there is still next link, keep clicking
    .......

Life:
    while you are hungry, keep eating
==============================
warm up:
    add new package day25_loops
    add new class WhileHungry
    boolean isHungry = true;
    int bananas = 0;
    int countToFull = 3;
    it takes 3 bananas for isHungry to be set to false
    while hungry
        eat banana 1
        if bananas reaches countToFull
            set hungry to false
        increase banana by 1
====================================
While, and do while loops, can be used with numbers as conditions , or boolean variables, boolean statements.
FOR LOOP:
another type of loop in java is FOR LOOP:
2 types of FOR LOOP:
    1) for loop with iterator/counter
    2) for each loop -> works with collections, need array topic to learn

FOR LOOP -> normally used when we know how many times it should repeat beforehand.
-----------------------------------
add new class ForLoopFirst
main method
add new class PrintStars
using for loop print 15 stars in same line
"* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * "

--------------------------------
add new class SumOfNumbers
main method
int sum = 0;
count 1 to 5
and calculate the sum.
1+2+3+4+5
outside the loop:
we print sum
--------------------
add new class PrintEvenOrOddNumbers
1) print all even numbers between 1-100
2) print all odd numbers between 1-100
add new class FizzBuzz
main method
loop from 1 to 100
    when num divisible by 3 and 5
        -> "FizzBuzz"
    when num divisible by 3
        -> "Fizz"
    when num divisible by 5
        -> "Buzz"
    else
        -> print num
------------------------------------
add new class StartEnd
implement scanner
Enter start and end
int start
int end
print all numbers from start till end separated by space
start = 3
end = 6
3 4 5 6
start = 30
end = 6
when start is more than end,
    "reverse numbering is not supported"
--------------------------------------
