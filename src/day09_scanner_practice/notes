Java Programming Day 9
Casting Scanner class, how to use it.

new Package day09_scanner_practice new class AskAgeV1 main method

Flow: print "How old are you?" age -> 22 print "22 - thats great age!"
new class AskAgeV2 main method

print "How old are you?" age -> System input scan.nextInt(); print "age - thats great age!"

import day09_scanner_practice.AskAgeV1;

IMPORT SCANNER:
import java.util.Scanner; java.util -> is a package name where Scanner class is located.

import means, "I would like to use this class in my program, so import it."

Create Scanner object
Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);

Scanner scan -> declare a variable of data type Scanner String name; int age; Scanner is non-primitive , object type, class type. Scanner is class name

new -> create new object from a class

use scanner function/method to accept int from keyboard
nextInt -> accept int value (whole number) from keyboard/console

So we have been assigning values into variables in our java programs, like int n = 33;

Scanner can be used to enter different values when programming is running. We enter values to our variables from keyboard, then that value will go into our variable

int n = 33; -> value 33 is already assigned to n variable

int n = scan.nextInt(); -> value will be assigned from console/keyboard when program is running

EX: Enter number: 44

44 will be assigned into n variable now.

HARDCODING the value: assigning the value to a variable in your CODE. Not from scanner or any other source.
Scanner class gives us a capability to pass values/inputs into our java programs. interactive way.
When we installed jdk/java, many ready classes came with it. for examples String, System, Scanner etc. We can use them in our java programs. In order to use them we need to import first. we type import packagename.Classname; import java.util.Scanner;

It means that you want to use that Class in your program. Once imported, we need to create object from that class first.

Create scanner object: variable name can be different Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in); Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in); Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in); Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);

After object is created, now we can call/use its functions:

nextInt() -> used to input int value nextByte() -> used to input byte value nextShort() -> used to input short value nextLong() -> used to input long value

nextFloat() -> used to input float value nextDouble() -> used to input double value nextBoolean() -> used to input boolean value

next() -> used to input string , single word, until space nextLine() -> used to input whole sentence as String

nextChar() is not there.
Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in); int num = scan.nextInt();

line 105 -> is declare and create scanner object, then 106, we are using that Object to input an int value
add new class AddNumbers add main method 3 variables: num1, num2, result FLOW: Enter 2 numbers 5 4 Result: 9
import scanner create scanner object ask question: Enter 2 numbers using scanner input 2 int numbers num1 = scan.nextInt(); num2 = scan.nextInt(); result -> num1+num2 print Result: 10
add new class SalaryCalculator main method import scanner assume 40 hours of work in a week Enter hourly rate 50 we need calculate: weeklyPay, monthlyPay, annualPay

print all three in 3 lines
add new class SpeedCheckV1 add main method

speedlimit -> 55 currentSpeed -> 75 overTheLimit -> currentSpeed - speedlimit;

You are driving 20 mph over the limit. Slow down!
add new class SpeedCheckV2 add main method import scanner Create scanner object ask to enter current Speed speedlimit -> 55 currentSpeed -> 75 overTheLimit -> currentSpeed - speedlimit;

You are driving 20 mph over the limit. Slow down!
Add a new class GroceryShopping add main method import scanner create scanner object

Target

milk, bread, cucumber
FLOW: Enter price for milk: 3.99 Enter price for bread: 2.55 Enter price for cucumbers: 4.10 Total is $10.33

price1, price2, price3, total
add new class Miles2KmConverter add main method import scanner create scanner object miles, kilometers

Enter miles: 10 10 miles in kilometers: 16.0934
formula: kilometers -> miles * 1.609
add new class TempConverter add main method import scanner create scanner object welcome message ask to enter Fahrenheit value celciusValue ->

remainder operator|MODULUS -> %

This operator returns remainder of 2 numbers when divided.

add new class RemainderOperator main method

When it is useful

100 cents -> 1

115 cents -> 1 1 115 % 100 -> 100+15

100 minutes
add new class CentsToDollars add main method

cents -> 123 dollars -> 1 remainingCents -> 23

print: in 123 cents : 1 dollars 23 cents

REFACTORING THE CODE. update existing working code, in order to improve it, or add additional feature

DEBUGGING THE CODE: looks for bugs in the code and try to fix them so that it works as expected
