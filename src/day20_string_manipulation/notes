Java Programming Day 20
String Manipulation methods.

String is a class. From String class we create objects: String class -> String object -> String object etc

Scanner -> import java.util.Scanner; String -> AUTO import java.lang.String

Scanner import: -> import java.util.Scanner; -> import java.util.*;

import all classes from java.util package
-> means everything.
When we use .* , it does not mean that all imported classes are loaded to our program. Only the ones that we actually use are loaded to our program.

String - it is a class, but we never had to import it. System.out.println(); System is also a class, but we never had to import it. Why? Answer: They are automatically imported by compiler.

each class that we have been writing so far, compiler automatically added below import statement.

import java.lang.*; is automatically included. But we can type if we want to.

package day01_intro;

import java.lang.*;

public class HelloWorld { public static void main(String[] args) { System.out.println("Hello World"); String word = "java"; } }

Rodrigo Escobar — Today at 7:17 PM do all ide do this or is it just intellij? - @Murodil

No, it is part of java, java compiler adds this import for us while translating our code.
package > import (s) > class

String object creation:

=> "hello" -> it is automatically a String object. "hello".toUpperCase(); => HELLO "" -> is also a empty string object. it is String object because of "".

=> String word = "java"; String today = "03/22/2021 Monday"; String str = "";

=> String cellPhone = new String("HTC"); String city = new String("Vienna/Ashburn"); String company = new String();

Java Memory management -> Stack, Heap (String pool)...

add new package day20_string_manipulation import java.lang.*; add new class StringCreationMethods main method String word1 = "potato"; String word2 = new String("tomato");

java.lang and java.util are packages.

means import all classes.
import java.lang.; import java.util.;

when you have import and it is grey color, it means it is a unused import. means: you imported but never used any class that comes from that import.

Make sure to not to have UNused import in your class before you submit your code for review.
import java.lang.*;

above is automatically imported by compiler to each class, we do not need to type it. String, System classes come from java.lang package.
STRING MANIPULATION METHODS:

-> equals() -> equalsIgnoreCase() -> startsWith(), endsWith() -> toUpperCase(), toLowerCase(); -> length() - number of characters.

String str = ""; str.length() --> 0
-> isEmpty() -> checks if a String is empty "", returns boolean(true/false)

EX: String car = "lexus"; System.out.println(car.isEmpty()); //false - NOT empty

String city = " ";
System.out.println(city.isEmpty()); //true

System.out.println(city.length() == 0); //true
System.out.println(city.equals("")); //true
System.out.println(city.equalsIgnoreCase("")); //true
Mohammad Ali Ali Nazhed — Today at 8:20 PM So empty method take true even for space

" " -> there is a space, respect the space. it is independent character in computer. " " IS NOT empty. there 1 character (space) is there.

add new class StringIsEmpty main method

String jobTitle = "";

3 STEPS TO LEARN ANY METHOD:

what does it accept: str.isEmpty(); str.length(); str.equals("some other string") -> some methods do not accept any inputs, some do.

what does method do: logic/purpose of the method: isEmpty -> checks if string is empty, no chars

length() -> counts number of characters

what does method return isEmpty -> boolean length -> int toUpperCase() -> String Some methods/functions return value and some do not.

For Login test, as a practice check if userName or password are empty. if yes, print cannot be empty.

CONTAINS METHOD IN STRING:

Checks if string is within the variable value and returns true or false. It is case sensitive

String word = "java"; System.out.println(word.contains("v")); //TRUE System.out.println(word.contains("va")); //TRUE System.out.println(word.contains("ja")); //TRUE System.out.println(word.contains("a")); //TRUE System.out.println(word.contains("jv")); //FALSE System.out.println(word.contains("Ja")); //FALSE

add new class StringContains add main method

String email = "MURODIL@cybertekschool.com"; //CASE insensitive contains if(email.toLowerCase().contains("d")) { System.out.println("d is present"); }else{ System.out.println("d is not present"); }

Goes from left to right. first convert to lowercase, then check if "d" is present.
REPLACE() method in String class:

it searches in the string and replaces with another string.

String word = "java";

word.replace("a","u") -> "juvu"

String sentence = "java strings are fun";

add new class StringReplace main method
