Java Programming Day 17
Tomorrow and Thursday are Nadir's classes.

Conditional Statements in java: -> if conditions: -> if -> if .. else .. -> if .. else if .. else if .. else -> nested if -> switch: -> switch .. case .. break .. case ..break .. default -> nested switch -> ternary: -> variable = condition? trueValue : falseValue;
add new package day17_ternary_nested_conditions add new class TernaryExamples

TERNARY OPERATOR ? can be used for short conditions where you assign one value or another based on condition.

int num1 = 10; int num2 = 30; int max = num1 > num2? num1 : num2; print max; ==> 30

if(max > 5){ System.out.println("more than 5"); }else{ System.out.println("NOT more than 5"); }

ADVANTAGES:

one statement to replace basic if else statement
--> if else is more flexible when you have multi branch conditions.
if(price > 100) { itemName = "wooden spoon"; payment = "Visa"; }else { itemName = "tea"; payment = "cash"; }

ternary cannot handle the above statement. it has limitation to be able to return a single value.
add new class MoreTernary main method

hourlyRate = 50;

when hourlyRate > 45 reply = "accept" otherwise reply = "reject" print out reply
NESTED IF STATEMENT:

We can put IF statement inside IF statement. That is called NESTED IF statement.

if(condition1) { if(condition2) { //code A }else{ //code B } }else{ if(condition3) { //code C }else { //code D } }
condition1, condition2 are true : code A
condition1 is true, condition2 is false: code B
condition1 is false. condition3 is true: code C
condition1, condition2, condition3 ALL false: code D.
add new class AmazomPrimeShopping main method

itemPrice = 30; isPrimeMember = true;

when isPrimeMember is true print "Eligible for free 2 day shipping" otherwise when itemPrice is more than 25 print "Eligible for free regular shipping" otherwise print "Not eligible for free shipping. fee is $10"

PSEUDOCODE: code written in human language. then it will be translated to java or other programming language

add new class VendingNestedIf add main method

selection = "drink" or can be "snack" drinkItem = "tea" , "coke" snackItem = "chips" , "candy"

when selection is "drink": "drink option is selected"

when drinkItem is "tea":
	"tea is selected"
when drinkItem is "coke":
	"coke is selected"
when selection is "snack" "snack option is selected"

when snackItem is "chips":
	"chips item is selected"
when snackItem is "candy":
	"candy item is selected"

char model = 'S'; trim -> "Long range"

when model 'S' if trim is "long range":
